Introduction to JavaScript
==========================

This is to help walk you through the basics of JavaScript, on of the most used programming languages for the web, and now for desktop and mobile.

In order to run the JavaScript files in the console/terminal, you should copy and paste this code there

`node --watch data-types.js` 

**NB**: You'll need to locate the file in the terminal in order for the code to work

This is how to change directory to where the file is:

`cd basic-data-types`

Do keep your terminal/console open so you see the changes made to your code live!!!

Good luck and enjoy ðŸš€
